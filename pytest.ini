[pytest]
markers =
    integration: Integration tests (cloud services, external dependencies)
    slow: Slow tests (network latency, large datasets)
    unit: Unit tests (fast, no external dependencies)

# Default: Run only non-slow tests (PR gate)
addopts = -v --tb=short

# Example usage:
# pytest                    # Run all except slow
# pytest -m "not slow"      # Explicit: skip slow tests
# pytest -m integration     # Run only integration tests
# pytest -m slow            # Run only slow tests
